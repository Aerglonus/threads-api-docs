# ðŸ“’ API References

These are all the methods that can be used.

:::caution Important
Some of these methods require the following:

- Profile must be public in order to retrieve threads,replies, profile info.
- 2FA must be disabled (this is required to be able to login)

:::

:::info Advice
It is recommended to use `token` and `userID` instead of `username` and `password` and pass `deviceID` and `device identifiers` to avoid issues with Instagram.
