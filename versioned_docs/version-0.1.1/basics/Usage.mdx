# Basic Usage

## Creating the Client

The first thing to do is you need to create a Client. The most basic client configuration is passing the properties `username` and `password`

```typescript
const threadsAPI = new ThreadsAPI({
	username: "", // here goes your Threads/Instagram username
	password: "",
});
```

Once you created the client its recommended to run the `login()` method to retrieve the token and userID.

```typescript
const credentials = await ThreadsAPI.login();
// Response:
// {
//  token: //bearer-token,
//  userID: //your-username-id
// }
```

:::info Note:
Its recommended that once you get the Bearer Token and userID store them and pass them directly in the client options or through and .env file

## Making your first Threads post.

threads-api allows you to make a post with multiple images, quote a thread or reply to a thread. For now to do a simple post you can do the following:

```typescript
const post = await threadsAPI.publish({
	text: "Hello World!",
});
```

The `client` and `publish` method contain more options that you can pass to them like `deviceID`, `device identifiers` to prevent the `unrecognized login` notification from Instagram, `attachments` that allows you to pass urls, images, etc. you can learn more in [references](/docs/references/).
